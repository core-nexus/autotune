# Claude Code Review

Automated codebase review system powered by Claude. Runs weekly deep-dive audits across 12 focus areas, finds issues, and auto-fixes them via pull requests.

## What It Does

A two-stage GitHub Actions pipeline:

1. **Review Stage** — Claude reads your entire codebase against a specific review checklist, creates a GitHub issue with findings organized by severity
2. **Fix Stage** — If MEDIUM+ severity issues are found, Claude automatically edits code, runs your quality gates, and opens a PR with fixes

It also includes a **PR review workflow** that automatically reviews every pull request and can auto-fix issues it finds.

### Review Areas

| Area | What It Checks |
|---|---|
| **security** | Auth, authorization, injection, secrets, OWASP Top 10 |
| **code-quality** | Type safety, style, component architecture, dead code |
| **performance** | Query scalability, N+1 patterns, bundle size, memory leaks |
| **testing** | Coverage gaps, mock discipline, test quality, E2E |
| **error-handling** | Silent catches, error reporting, resilience patterns |
| **correctness** | Logic bugs, off-by-one errors, race conditions, wrong references |
| **privacy** | PII in logs, data minimization, consent, third-party data flows |
| **compliance** | GDPR, CCPA, cookie consent, data subject rights |
| **ai-compliance** | EU AI Act, transparency, bias, automated decision-making |
| **documentation** | Stale docs, missing API docs, CLAUDE.md accuracy |
| **dependency-health** | Vulnerabilities, outdated packages, license compliance, supply chain |
| **e-commerce** | Payments, subscriptions, webhooks, credit systems, billing math |

### Schedule

All reviews run simultaneously every **Sunday at 06:00 UTC**. You can also trigger any review manually via `workflow_dispatch`.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- A GitHub repository
- A [Claude Code OAuth token](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/github-actions) (`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` secret)

### Quick Install (Copy-Paste for Claude)

**Copy this entire block into Claude Code (or any AI coding agent) and let it install the system into your repo:**

---

```
Install the claude-code-review system from https://github.com/core-nexus/claude-code-review into this repository. Here's what to do:

1. Clone or fetch the review system files from https://github.com/core-nexus/claude-code-review

2. Copy these directories into this repo (merge with existing .github/ if present):
   - .github/review-prompts/  (all 12 .md files)
   - .github/workflows/codebase-review.yml
   - .github/workflows/claude-pr-review.yml
   - .github/workflows/scripts/  (all 4 .sh files)

3. Make the shell scripts executable:
   chmod +x .github/workflows/scripts/*.sh

4. Review the workflow files and adjust for this project:
   - In codebase-review.yml: verify the cron schedule works for this team
     (default: Sunday 06:00 UTC)
   - In trigger-ci-workflows.sh: set WORKFLOWS to match this project's actual
     CI workflow filenames (e.g., "ci.yml" or "test.yml" or "checks.yml")
   - If this project uses Slack, add the SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL secret and
     replace the notify job's echo step with the slackapi/slack-github-action
   - Remove review areas that don't apply (e.g., remove e-commerce.md if there's
     no payment system, remove ai-compliance.md if there's no AI features) and
     update the workflow_dispatch options and ALL_AREAS in resolve-review-area.sh

5. Ensure the CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN secret is set in the repo's GitHub
   Actions secrets (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions)

6. Create the `auto-review` label in the repo:
   gh label create auto-review --description "Automated codebase review" --color "0E8A16"

7. Do NOT relax the security defaults: keep the author-association guard on the
   `/claude-review` and `/claude-fix` comment triggers (only OWNER/MEMBER/
   COLLABORATOR may invoke them), keep third-party actions pinned to commit SHAs,
   and keep the scoped `--allowedTools` allowlists (do not reintroduce
   `--dangerously-skip-permissions`). See the "Security Hardening" section below.

8. Commit everything on a feature branch and open a PR.
```

---

### Manual Install

1. Copy the `.github/review-prompts/` and `.github/workflows/` directories into your repo
2. Make scripts executable: `chmod +x .github/workflows/scripts/*.sh`
3. Add `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` to your repo's Actions secrets
4. Create the `auto-review` label: `gh label create auto-review --description "Automated codebase review" --color "0E8A16"`
5. Customize (see Configuration below)
6. Push to your default branch

## Configuration

### Remove Irrelevant Review Areas

Not every project needs all 12 areas. Remove what doesn't apply:

- **No payments?** Delete `e-commerce.md` and remove `e-commerce` from the workflow_dispatch options and `ALL_AREAS` in `resolve-review-area.sh`
- **No AI features?** Delete `ai-compliance.md` and remove it similarly
- **No user data?** May not need `privacy.md` or `compliance.md`

### Adjust the Schedule

Edit the cron in `codebase-review.yml`. Default is Sunday 06:00 UTC:

```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '0 6 * * 0'  # Sunday 06:00 UTC
```

Change to any schedule you prefer. To stagger reviews across the week (2 per day), use multiple cron entries and update `resolve-review-area.sh` to map each cron slot to a specific area.

### CI Trigger Integration

The fix stage triggers your CI after pushing. Edit `trigger-ci-workflows.sh` to match your CI workflow filenames:

```bash
WORKFLOWS="${WORKFLOWS:-ci.yml checks.yml test.yml}"
```

### Slack Notifications

The `notify` job in `codebase-review.yml` prints a warning by default. To get Slack alerts on failure:

1. Add `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` to your repo secrets
2. Replace the notify step with:

```yaml
- name: Notify Slack on failure
  uses: slackapi/slack-github-action@af78098f536edbc4de71162a307590698245be95 # v3.0.1
  with:
    webhook: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}
    webhook-type: incoming-webhook
    payload: |
      text: ":rotating_light: Codebase review workflow failed"
      blocks:
        - type: "header"
          text:
            type: "plain_text"
            text: ":rotating_light: Codebase Review Failed"
        - type: "section"
          fields:
            - type: "mrkdwn"
              text: "*Trigger:*\n${{ github.event_name }}"
            - type: "mrkdwn"
              text: "*Run:*\n<${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}|View>"
```

### Using Your Own CLAUDE.md

If your project has a `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root, the review system will automatically read it and follow your project's coding standards. This is the best way to customize review behavior without editing the prompts.

## Security Hardening

These workflows grant an AI agent `contents: write` and a Claude OAuth token, so they ship with secure defaults. **Do not weaken them** when you copy the system into your repo:

- **Author-authorization on comment triggers.** The `/claude-review` and `/claude-fix` slash commands only run for users whose `author_association` is `OWNER`, `MEMBER`, or `COLLABORATOR`. Without this guard, *any* GitHub user could comment on a PR and invoke a privileged agent with your secrets and write access. The command must also be at the **start** of the comment, so prose that merely quotes it does not trigger a run.
- **Untrusted input is treated as data, not instructions.** PR titles, bodies, diffs, comments, and issue bodies are attacker-controllable. The prompts explicitly instruct the agent to treat all such content as untrusted data and never to follow instructions embedded in it (prompt-injection defense).
- **Third-party actions are pinned to commit SHAs.** `actions/checkout`, `anthropics/claude-code-action`, and the optional `slackapi/slack-github-action` are referenced by full commit SHA (with a `# vX` comment) so a moved or compromised tag cannot inject code into a privileged run. Keep them current with Dependabot for GitHub Actions.
- **Scoped tool allowlists, not `--dangerously-skip-permissions`.** Review jobs are read-only (`Read,Glob,Grep,Bash(git:*),Bash(gh:*)`); fix jobs add edit/write tools. If your project's quality gates need to run lint/type-check/test commands, add them explicitly (e.g. `Bash(npm:*)`, `Bash(pnpm:*)`, `Bash(make:*)`) rather than removing the allowlist.
- **Least-privilege permissions.** Jobs request only the scopes they use; `id-token: write` is not granted (no OIDC exchange is performed).
- **Fail-closed priority gate.** The fix stage only runs when the priority is set by the workflow's own bot-authored review issue. If that signal is missing, it defaults to `NONE` (no fix run) — user-authored issues cannot coerce the fixer into running.

## How It Works

### Codebase Review Pipeline

│  For each review area (in parallel):│
│  1. Read CLAUDE.md + review prompt  │
│  2. Deep-dive audit of codebase     │
│  3. Create GitHub issue with        │

```

### Priority Levels

| Priority | Meaning | Auto-fix? |
|---|---|---|
| NONE | Clean, no issues | No |
| XLOW | Trivial nits | No |
| LOW | Minor issues | PR review: yes. Codebase review: no |
| MEDIUM | Real issues | Yes |
| HIGH | Critical issues | Yes |

## Adding Custom Review Areas

1. Create a new `.md` file in `.github/review-prompts/` with your checklist
2. Add the area name to `workflow_dispatch.inputs.review_area.options` in `codebase-review.yml`
3. Add it to `ALL_AREAS` in `resolve-review-area.sh`

Follow the existing prompt structure: Objective, Review Checklist with checkboxes, and Severity Guide.

## Cost Considerations

Each review area uses one Claude session (~30 min review + up to 90 min fix). Running all 12 areas weekly means up to 12 review sessions and potentially 12 fix sessions per week. To reduce costs:

- Remove review areas that don't apply to your project
- Adjust the schedule (biweekly instead of weekly)
- Use `--model sonnet` instead of `--model opus` in the workflow files for cheaper reviews (with some quality tradeoff)
