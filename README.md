# Claude Code Review

Automated codebase review system powered by Claude. Runs weekly deep-dive audits across 12 focus areas, finds issues, and auto-fixes them via pull requests.

## What It Does

A two-stage GitHub Actions pipeline:

1. **Review Stage** — Claude reads your entire codebase against a specific review checklist, creates a GitHub issue with findings organized by severity
2. **Fix Stage** — If MEDIUM+ severity issues are found, Claude automatically edits code, runs your quality gates, and opens a PR with fixes

It also includes a **PR review workflow** that automatically reviews every pull request and can auto-fix issues it finds.

### Review Areas

| Area | What It Checks |
|---|---|
| **security** | Auth, authorization, injection, secrets, OWASP Top 10 |
| **code-quality** | Type safety, style, component architecture, dead code |
| **performance** | Query scalability, N+1 patterns, bundle size, memory leaks |
| **testing** | Coverage gaps, mock discipline, test quality, E2E |
| **error-handling** | Silent catches, error reporting, resilience patterns |
| **correctness** | Logic bugs, off-by-one errors, race conditions, wrong references |
| **privacy** | PII in logs, data minimization, consent, third-party data flows |
| **compliance** | GDPR, CCPA, cookie consent, data subject rights |
| **ai-compliance** | EU AI Act, transparency, bias, automated decision-making |
| **documentation** | Stale docs, missing API docs, CLAUDE.md accuracy |
| **dependency-health** | Vulnerabilities, outdated packages, license compliance, supply chain |
| **e-commerce** | Payments, subscriptions, webhooks, credit systems, billing math |

### Schedule

All reviews run simultaneously every **Sunday at 06:00 UTC**. You can also trigger any review manually via `workflow_dispatch`.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- A GitHub repository
- A [Claude Code OAuth token](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/github-actions) (`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` secret)

### Quick Install (Copy-Paste for Claude)

**Copy this entire block into Claude Code (or any AI coding agent) and let it install the system into your repo:**

---

```
Install the claude-code-review system from https://github.com/core-nexus/claude-code-review into this repository. Here's what to do:

1. Clone or fetch the review system files from https://github.com/core-nexus/claude-code-review

2. Copy these directories into this repo (merge with existing .github/ if present):
   - .github/review-prompts/  (all 12 .md files)
   - .github/workflows/codebase-review.yml
   - .github/workflows/claude-pr-review.yml
   - .github/workflows/scripts/  (all 4 .sh files)

3. Make the shell scripts executable:
   chmod +x .github/workflows/scripts/*.sh

4. Review the workflow files and adjust for this project:
   - In codebase-review.yml: verify the cron schedule works for this team
     (default: Sunday 06:00 UTC)
   - In trigger-ci-workflows.sh: set WORKFLOWS to match this project's actual
     CI workflow filenames (e.g., "ci.yml" or "test.yml" or "checks.yml")
   - If this project uses Slack, add the SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL secret and
     replace the notify job's echo step with the slackapi/slack-github-action
   - Remove review areas that don't apply (e.g., remove e-commerce.md if there's
     no payment system, remove ai-compliance.md if there's no AI features) and
     update the workflow_dispatch options and ALL_AREAS in resolve-review-area.sh

5. Ensure the CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN secret is set in the repo's GitHub
   Actions secrets (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions)

6. Create the `auto-review` label in the repo:
   gh label create auto-review --description "Automated codebase review" --color "0E8A16"

7. Commit everything on a feature branch and open a PR.
```

---

### Manual Install

1. Copy the `.github/review-prompts/` and `.github/workflows/` directories into your repo
2. Make scripts executable: `chmod +x .github/workflows/scripts/*.sh`
3. Add `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` to your repo's Actions secrets
4. Create the `auto-review` label: `gh label create auto-review --description "Automated codebase review" --color "0E8A16"`
5. Customize (see Configuration below)
6. Push to your default branch

## Configuration

### Remove Irrelevant Review Areas

Not every project needs all 12 areas. Remove what doesn't apply:

- **No payments?** Delete `e-commerce.md` and remove `e-commerce` from the workflow_dispatch options and `ALL_AREAS` in `resolve-review-area.sh`
- **No AI features?** Delete `ai-compliance.md` and remove it similarly
- **No user data?** May not need `privacy.md` or `compliance.md`

### Adjust the Schedule

Edit the cron in `codebase-review.yml`. Default is Sunday 06:00 UTC:

```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '0 6 * * 0'  # Sunday 06:00 UTC
```

Change to any schedule you prefer. To stagger reviews across the week (2 per day), use multiple cron entries and update `resolve-review-area.sh` to map each cron slot to a specific area.

### CI Trigger Integration

The fix stage triggers your CI after pushing. Edit `trigger-ci-workflows.sh` to match your CI workflow filenames:

```bash
WORKFLOWS="${WORKFLOWS:-ci.yml checks.yml test.yml}"
```

### Slack Notifications

The `notify` job in `codebase-review.yml` prints a warning by default. To get Slack alerts on failure:

1. Add `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` to your repo secrets
2. Replace the notify step with:

```yaml
- name: Notify Slack on failure
  uses: slackapi/slack-github-action@v3.0.1
  with:
    webhook: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}
    webhook-type: incoming-webhook
    payload: |
      text: ":rotating_light: Codebase review workflow failed"
      blocks:
        - type: "header"
          text:
            type: "plain_text"
            text: ":rotating_light: Codebase Review Failed"
        - type: "section"
          fields:
            - type: "mrkdwn"
              text: "*Trigger:*\n${{ github.event_name }}"
            - type: "mrkdwn"
              text: "*Run:*\n<${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}|View>"
```

### Using Your Own CLAUDE.md

If your project has a `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root, the review system will automatically read it and follow your project's coding standards. This is the best way to customize review behavior without editing the prompts.

## Adding Custom Review Areas

1. Create a new `.md` file in `.github/review-prompts/` with your checklist
2. Add the area name to `workflow_dispatch.inputs.review_area.options` in `codebase-review.yml`
3. Add it to `ALL_AREAS` in `resolve-review-area.sh`

Follow the existing prompt structure: Objective, Review Checklist with checkboxes, and Severity Guide.

## Data Flow & Third-Party Processing

This system invokes Claude (the AI model produced by Anthropic) on every
scheduled and on-demand run. As a deployer of this workflow, you are
responsible for ensuring your organisation, contributors, and users are
aware of the data flow described below before installing it.

**What is transmitted to Anthropic on each run:**

- The full content of the repository at the commit being reviewed (the
  workflow runs `actions/checkout@v4` and Claude can read any file in
  the workspace). This includes any code, configuration, comments, and
  inadvertently committed secrets.
- For PR reviews: the PR diff, PR description, and PR comments.
- For codebase reviews: any prior `auto-review` issue and PR bodies and
  comments that the workflow reads as context for de-duplication.
- The contents of any GitHub Actions logs Claude inspects for CI status
  checks during a fix stage.

**Where it goes:** Anthropic, via the Claude Code OAuth integration
configured by the `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` repository secret. Anthropic
processes this data subject to their published terms.

**Operational guidance for deployers:**

- Review Anthropic's commercial terms and data-handling policies at
  <https://www.anthropic.com/legal> before installing this workflow into
  any repository that contains proprietary code, customer data, or any
  information subject to a data-processing agreement.
- Audit the repository for accidentally committed secrets BEFORE
  enabling this workflow — secrets present in the working tree will be
  transmitted on every run.
- Keep this workflow off repositories whose contents are subject to
  contractual confidentiality obligations that have not been mapped to
  Anthropic's processing terms.
- If your organisation maintains a record of data processors / sub-
  processors, add Anthropic for the scope described above.

## Known Limitations

This system is itself an AI-driven tool. It has not undergone a formal
external audit and has the following documented limitations. Maintainers
should treat its output as an aid, not a substitute for human review.

- **Findings can be silently skipped.** If the model output deviates
  from the expected `MAXIMUM_FIX_PRIORITY:<level>` format, the priority
  extraction emits a workflow warning and skips the fix stage for that
  area; the warning surfaces in the run summary and in the `notify`
  job, but a maintainer must read the run to act on it.
- **Auto-closure of superseded issues and PRs may lose coverage.** When
  a new review issue is filed, the workflow asks the model to close
  prior `auto-review` issues for the same area. The prompt now requires
  the model to enumerate which findings carry forward and which do not
  before closing, but a misclassification by the model can still drop
  findings between weekly runs. Inspect the closing comment on any
  superseded issue rather than trusting it blindly.
- **Pattern bias.** Like all LLM-based tools, the reviewer is biased
  toward patterns common in its training data. Reviews of niche
  frameworks, internal DSLs, or unusual architectures may be unreliable
  and should be treated with extra scepticism.
- **No formal bias audit.** The system has not been audited against
  recognised AI fairness or robustness benchmarks. It does not make
  decisions about natural persons (it reviews code), so this is a
  lower-stakes gap, but it is documented for transparency.
- **Stylistically consistent ≠ semantically correct.** The fix stage
  may rewrite code to match surrounding style while introducing subtle
  semantic changes. Every PR opened by this workflow MUST receive
  human review before merge; do not configure auto-merge for
  `auto-review` PRs.
- **Third-party data flow.** Every run transmits the entire repository
  content to Anthropic; see the "Data Flow & Third-Party Processing"
  section above.

## Cost Considerations

Each review area uses one Claude session (~30 min review + up to 90 min fix). Running all 12 areas weekly means up to 12 review sessions and potentially 12 fix sessions per week. To reduce costs:

- Remove review areas that don't apply to your project
- Adjust the schedule (biweekly instead of weekly)
- Use `--model sonnet` instead of `--model opus` in the workflow files for cheaper reviews (with some quality tradeoff)
