# Pre-warm the browser MCP server packages so that when claude-code-action
# subsequently launches them via `npx --yes`, the package is already
# cached on the runner and no registry round-trip is needed.
#
# The QA workflow's most common failure mode is npx flaking on a transient
# registry hiccup. When that happens the MCP server never starts,
# claude-code-action runs the agent with no `mcp__playwright__*` tools,
# and the agent falls into its "could not run" path. We can't observe
# the original npx failure from inside the agent — the user only sees
# the no-op comment with no clue WHY.
#
# This script:
#   1. Tries to install + boot each package up-front with exponential
#      backoff retries (3 attempts).
#   2. Captures every attempt's stderr to a log file under ARTIFACTS_DIR.
#   3. When BOTH packages fail, writes a diagnostic `_comment.md` so the
#      post-comment step posts a useful message to the PR (with log tails
#      and a link to the workflow run). Sets step outputs the workflow
#      uses to skip the (otherwise wasted) AI QA Review step.
#
# We deliberately do NOT fail when only one of the two packages fails —
# the agent's prompt treats Chrome DevTools MCP as a fallback for
# Playwright MCP and vice versa, so as long as one loads, browser QA
# is possible.
#
# Required env vars:
#   ARTIFACTS_DIR  - directory for logs and (on total failure) _comment.md
#   GITHUB_OUTPUT  - GitHub Actions step output file
#   RUN_URL        - URL to the calling workflow run (for the failure comment)
#
# Step outputs written to GITHUB_OUTPUT:
#   playwright-ok=true|false
#   chrome-devtools-ok=true|false
#   any-ok=true|false

## 🤖 AI QA Review — could not run

Browser automation was unavailable in this run: neither the Playwright MCP nor the Chrome DevTools MCP could be installed by \`npx\`. The QA pass is a no-op — no browser session, no screenshots, no video evidence.

### Diagnostic

Pre-install attempted 3× per package with exponential backoff and still failed. See the [workflow run](${RUN_URL}) for the full logs, or expand the tails below.

${LOG_TAILS}

If this is happening repeatedly, investigate the workflow's MCP configuration in \`.github/workflows/ai-qa-review.yml\` and the prewarm script at \`.github/workflows/scripts/prewarm-qa-mcp.sh\`.
